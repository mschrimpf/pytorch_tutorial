# PyTorch Tutorial
presented on 21 Aug 2019 at the [MIT-Harvard Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience Journal Club](https://compneurojc.github.io/).

## Setup
If you have conda (suggested), run
```
conda install numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter tqdm
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```
You can also `pip install "pytorch_tutorial @ git+https://github.com/mschrimpf/pytorch_tutorial", 
or `pip install` by hand.

In general, I also recommend using the [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), but you can use whatever you are comfortable with.

For this tutorial, please have a [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook server running.
