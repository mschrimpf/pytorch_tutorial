# PyTorch Tutorial
presented on 21 Aug 2019 at the [MIT-Harvard Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience Journal Club](https://compneurojc.github.io/).

## Goals of this tutorial

1. You have been exposed to PyTorch, ideally even run it
2. When someone sends modeling code to you, you're comfortable going through it
3. You have a reference to look things up or start building your own models


## Setup
If you have conda (suggested), run
```
conda install numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter tqdm
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```
You can also `pip install "pytorch_tutorial @ git+https://github.com/mschrimpf/pytorch_tutorial", 
or `pip install` by hand.

In general, I also recommend using the [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), but you can use whatever you are comfortable with.

For this tutorial, please have a [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook server running.
